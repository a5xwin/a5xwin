sr yr cs undergrad from india. big-time custom rom nerd- been flashing since cwm had orange text and broke more than it fixed. emulation enjoyer and proud r/degoogle supporter.
started out tweaking s40 themes, ended up debugging bootloops with adb. still that go-to tech guy for friends and fam. somewhere between xda threads and low-level tech.
