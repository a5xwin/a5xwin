sr yr cs undergrad from india. used to sideload xposed before magisk was a thing. emulation enjoyer and proud r/degoogle supporter.
started out tweaking s40 themes, ended up debugging bootloops with adb. still that go-to tech guy for friends and fam, floating somewhere between xda threads and low-level tech.
